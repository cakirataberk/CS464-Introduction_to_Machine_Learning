The notebook is saved with the all results and plots.
There is no need to re run. 
However if the grader wants to re run it is designed as to work in a drive environment.
Since  I could not read the data.zip file first unzip the file inside the drive as a folder called "data"
The grader should do this before running the get_dataset() function.
After running cells the paths are also saved into the drive. 
If you want to call them you should first upload them into drive.
